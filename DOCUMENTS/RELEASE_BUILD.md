## Demonstration Build

The repository is intended as a demonstration / proof-of-concept build only.

It is not intended for production use, particularly where GUIDs as concerned.

Various changes are required to ensure it is suitable for distribution to end-users as a production build.

## Production Build


Two approaches are available to prepare a production build

1. Edit the existing Visual Studio Solution

Change all GUIDs in all files to newly-created values.

2. Create a new Visual Studio Solution.

This is the preferred approach.
