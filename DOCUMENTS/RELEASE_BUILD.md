## Demonstration Build

The repository is intended as a demonstration / proof-of-concept build only.

It is not intended for production use, particularly where GUIDs as concerned.

Various changes are required to ensure it is suitable for distribution to end-users as a production build.

## Production Build

Two approaches are available to prepare a production build

<details><summary>Edit the existing Visual Studio Solution</summary>
<p>

The design goals for this project are therefore :-

* Change all GUIDs in all files to newly-created values.

</p>
</details> 

<details><summary>Create a new Visual Studio Solution</summary>
<p>

This is the preferred approach.
