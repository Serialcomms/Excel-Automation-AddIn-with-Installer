# Excel Automation Add-In with Installer in VB.Net
Excel Automation Add-In with Installer in VB.Net

Excel User-Defined Functions (UDFs) as developed in VB.Net have been around for many years, an early example of which is published here - http://www.cpearson.com/Excel/CreatingNETFunctionLib.aspx

Whilst these functions work well, the deployment of them can be more problematic, particularly where end users may not be familiar with, or permitted to, run command line utilities such as RegAsm to complete the installation. 

The design goals for this project are therefore :-

1.  Integrated 'Click-Through' installer, more familiar to end-users
2.  All development in VB.Net, using Microsoft Visual Studio 2022
3.  No third-party libraries, or utilies required
4.
