# Excel Automation Add-In with Installer in VB.Net
Functional Excel Automation Add-In with Installer, both written in VB.Net

Full Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 solution and project source code.

<details><summary>Background Information</summary>
<p>
  
Excel User-Defined Functions (UDFs) as developed in VB.Net have been around for many years, early examples of which are published here -

Whilst these functions work well, the deployment of them can be more problematic, particularly where end users may not be familiar with, or permitted to, run command line utilities such as RegAsm to complete the installation.
